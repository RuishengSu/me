Ruisheng is an Assistant Professor in the [Medical Image Analysis group (IMAG/e)](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/research-groups/medical-image-analysis) at TU Eindhoven and Research Scientist at Erasmus MC, The Netherlands. He obtained his PhD degree (cum laude) at the Biomedical Imaging Group Rotterdam ([BIGR](https://bigr.nl/)) at [Erasmus MC](https://www.erasmusmc.nl/en/), where his research centered on innovative AI-based medical image/video analysis techniques and clinical applications in minimally invasive endovascular interventions for acute ischemic stroke. Prior to this, he completed his Master's degree from TU Munich, and accrued five years of industrial experience as a software engineer at ASML, and a research scientist at Philips Research. He is the organizing chair of the [SWITCH stroke workshop](https://switchmiccai.github.io/switch/) at MICCAI 2023 and 2024. 

His current research focuses on trustworthy AI-based image analysis methods and applications in the field of neurovascular diseases (e.g., stroke, aneurysms) and image-guided interventions.
