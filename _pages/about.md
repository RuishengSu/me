Ruisheng is an Assistant Professor in the [Medical Image Analysis group (IMAG/e)](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/research-groups/medical-image-analysis) at TU Eindhoven. He is also the organizing chair of the [SWITCH stroke workshop](https://switchmiccai.github.io/switch/) at MICCAI 2023 and 2024. He was previously a (post-)doctoral researcher at the Biomedical Imaging Group Rotterdam ([BIGR](https://bigr.nl/)) at [Erasmus MC](https://www.erasmusmc.nl/en/), where his research centered on innovative AI-based medical image/video analysis techniques and clinical applications in minimally invasive endovascular interventions for acute ischemic stroke. Prior to this, he completed his Master's degree from TU Munich, and accrued five years of industrial experience as a software engineer at ASML, and a research scientist at Philips Research.

His current research focuses on trustworthy AI-based methods and applications in the field of neurovascular image analysis and image-guided interventions. If you are interested in Ruishengâ€™s work or have questions about potential collaborations, feel free to reach out for a discussion.
