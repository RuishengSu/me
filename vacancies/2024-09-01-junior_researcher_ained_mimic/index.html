Timely and precise treatment is crucial to rescue the brain. This necessitates accurate identification of stroke versus other conditions with similar clinical presentations, known as stroke mimics. Misdiagnosis carries risks of delayed or wrong treatment. To date, stroke mimics account for up to 40% of all suspected stroke hospital admissions. This project seeks to address the clinical challenge via AI-based innovations. This promises to discover novel clinical knowledge and refine stroke diagnosis, reducing healthcare expenses, and above all, enhancing patient outcomes in stroke care.
